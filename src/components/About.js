          My name is Nelson Chibukasia and I am a software developer with a
          passion for creating innovative and user-friendly digital solutions. I
          have a strong foundation in front-end development, with skills in
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with React. I also
          have experience with back-end development, including Ruby, Ruby on
          Rails, Python, and Djangorestframework. I am a dedicated learner and
          always strive to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest
          technologies. I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge to
          real-world projects and make a positive impact on the industry. I am a
          quick learner, team player and a problem solver. Although I am a fresh
          graduate, I have worked on a number of personal projects that have
          helped me to develop my skills and gain experience. I am excited to
          take on new challenges and continue to grow as a developer. In my free
          time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with
          different programming languages. I am always eager to take on new
          projects and collaborate with other developers to create innovative
          solutions
